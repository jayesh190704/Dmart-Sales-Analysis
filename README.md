## ðŸ›  Project Process

Data Collection & Cleaning â€“ Prepared sales, order, and customer data.
Data Modeling â€“ Built star schema with relationships.
KPI Development â€“ Defined sales, customer, and cost metrics.
Dashboard Design â€“ Interactive Power BI dashboard with cards & visuals.
Insights â€“ Strong sales, but high shipping cost, cancellations, and low rating need improvement.

# ðŸ”‘ Key Insights & Features
â€¢	Top Categories: FMCG and Electronics generate the highest sales and profit.
â€¢	Regional Performance: West Zone leads in revenue, while South Zone underperforms.
â€¢	Store Analysis: A few high-performing stores contribute a large share of overall sales.
â€¢	Customer Trends: Middle-aged customers dominate purchases; discounts boost sales volume but reduce profit margins.
â€¢	Product Insights: Top 5 products drive a significant percentage of total revenue.
â€¢	Interactive Dashboards: Four pages covering KPIs, Sales Analysis, Advanced Drilldowns, and Data Model Insights.
â€¢	Star Schema Data Model: Central Sales fact table linked with Product, Customer, Store, and Date dimensions.
â€¢	Decomposition Tree: Drill-down from Region â†’ Store â†’ Category â†’ Product.
â€¢	Visual Variety: Bar, Pie, Map, Funnel, Cards, and Network-style diagrams for deep analysis.


# ðŸŒŸ Why This Project Stands Out
â€¢	End-to-End BI Solution â€“ Covers the complete cycle from data modeling (Star Schema) to advanced visualization and insights.
â€¢	Multi-Page Interactive Dashboards â€“ Four well-structured pages (KPIs, Sales Analysis, Drilldowns, Data Model) for holistic reporting.
â€¢	Actionable Insights â€“ Goes beyond visuals by uncovering trends in customers, products, and regions that directly support decision-making.
â€¢	Advanced Features â€“ Includes decomposition tree, ER-style data relationships, and KPI cards for deep analytical capability.
â€¢	Professional Design â€“ Clean layout, varied visuals (maps, funnels, decomposition tree, cards), and user-friendly interactivity.
â€¢	Scalable Approach â€“ Built on a flexible star schema, making it easy to expand with new data (e.g., new stores, products, or time periods).

# Conclusion:
The project successfully analyzed and visualized data, providing clear insights to support informed business decisions. Key KPIs and trends were identified, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented methods.
#  Future Scope:
The project can be expanded by integrating real-time data, advanced analytics, and predictive modeling to further enhance decision-making and efficiency.
