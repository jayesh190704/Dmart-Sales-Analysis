# Dmart-Sales-Analysis
The Dmart Sales Analysis Project uses Power BI to analyze sales performance across products, customers, stores, and regions. The report provides interactive dashboards with KPIs, visual analysis, and drilldowns to track sales trends, identify top-performing categories, and evaluate regional performance. A star schema data model connects Sales with Product, Customer, Store, and Date dimensions, enabling clear insights for better business decisions.


# ðŸ”‘ Key Insights & Features
â€¢	Top Categories: FMCG and Electronics generate the highest sales and profit.
â€¢	Regional Performance: West Zone leads in revenue, while South Zone underperforms.
â€¢	Store Analysis: A few high-performing stores contribute a large share of overall sales.
â€¢	Customer Trends: Middle-aged customers dominate purchases; discounts boost sales volume but reduce profit margins.
â€¢	Product Insights: Top 5 products drive a significant percentage of total revenue.
â€¢	Interactive Dashboards: Four pages covering KPIs, Sales Analysis, Advanced Drilldowns, and Data Model Insights.
â€¢	Star Schema Data Model: Central Sales fact table linked with Product, Customer, Store, and Date dimensions.
â€¢	Decomposition Tree: Drill-down from Region â†’ Store â†’ Category â†’ Product.
â€¢	Visual Variety: Bar, Pie, Map, Funnel, Cards, and Network-style diagrams for deep analysis.

# ðŸŒŸ Why This Project Stands Out
â€¢	End-to-End BI Solution â€“ Covers the complete cycle from data modeling (Star Schema) to advanced visualization and insights.
â€¢	Multi-Page Interactive Dashboards â€“ Four well-structured pages (KPIs, Sales Analysis, Drilldowns, Data Model) for holistic reporting.
â€¢	Actionable Insights â€“ Goes beyond visuals by uncovering trends in customers, products, and regions that directly support decision-making.
â€¢	Advanced Features â€“ Includes decomposition tree, ER-style data relationships, and KPI cards for deep analytical capability.
â€¢	Professional Design â€“ Clean layout, varied visuals (maps, funnels, decomposition tree, cards), and user-friendly interactivity.
â€¢	Scalable Approach â€“ Built on a flexible star schema, making it easy to expand with new data (e.g., new stores, products, or time periods).
